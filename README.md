Projects made for school tasks

In this repository I have the projects that I have made for tasks in University of Tampere

Files HeapNode.java, PriorityQueue.java, Tira2016.java and UI.java are the implementation of priority queue done for a course work of course Data structures in 2016. After that I have not programmed much Java but at least some time ago I knew how to do something!
